| **memoryview**     | Allows access to memory buffer of another object without copying.               | `x = memoryview(b'Hello')`                 | Optimising memory usage when working with large datasets, allowing slicing and manipulation without extra memory allocation.                               |
| **NoneType**       | Represents the absence of a value or null object.                              | `x = None`                                 | Indicating missing or undefined values, and as a default parameter in functions.                                                                          |
